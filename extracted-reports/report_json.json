Vulnerabilities may vary depending on the logging facility:</p>\n                        <h5>1. Log Forging (CRLF) </h5>\n                        <p>Lets consider an example where an application logs a failed attempt to login to the system. A very common example for this is as follows:\n                        </p>\n                        <pre>\nvar userName = req.body.userName;\nconsole.log('Error: attempt to login with invalid user: ', userName);\n                        </pre>\n                        <p>When user input is unsanitized and the output mechanism is an ordinary terminal stdout facility then the application will be vulnerable to CRLF injection, where an attacker can create a malicious payload as follows:\n                        <pre>\ncurl http://localhost:4000/login -X POST --data 'userName=vyva%0aError: alex moldovan failed $1,000,000 transaction&password=Admin_123&_csrf='\n                        </pre>\n                        Where the <code>userName</code> parameter is encoding in the request the LF symbol which will result in a new line to begin. Resulting log output will look as follows:\n                        <pre>\nError: attempt to login with invalid user:  vyva\nError: alex moldovan failed $1,000,000 transaction\n                        </pre>\n                        <br/>\n                        <h5>2. Log Injection Escalation </h5>\n                        <p>\n                            An attacker may craft malicious input in hope of an escalated attack where the target isn't the logs themselves, but rather the actual logging system. For example, if an application has a back-office web app that manages viewing and tracking the logs, then an attacker may send an XSS payload into the log, which may not result in log forging on the log itself, but when viewed by a system administrator on the log viewing web app then it may compromise it and result in XSS injection that if the logs app is vulnerable.\n                        </p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n                    <div class=\"panel-heading\">\n                        <h3 class=\"panel-title\">How Do I Prevent It?</h3>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"panel-body\">\n\n                        As always when dealing with user input:\n                        <ul>\n                            <li>\n                                Do not allow user input into logs\n                            </li>\n                            <li>\n                                Encode to proper context, or sanitize user input\n                            </li>\n                        </ul>\n\n                        Encoding example:\n                        <pre>\n// Step 1: Require a module that supports encoding\nvar ESAPI = require('node-esapi');\n// - Step 2: Encode the user input that will be logged in the correct context\n// following are a few examples:\nconsole.log('Error: attempt to login with invalid user: %s', ESAPI.encoder().encodeForHTML(userName));\nconsole.log('Error: attempt to login with invalid user: %s', ESAPI.encoder().encodeForJavaScript(userName));\nconsole.log('Error: attempt to login with invalid user: %s', ESAPI.encoder().encodeForURL(userName));\n                        </pre>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n                    <div class=\"panel-heading\">\n                        <h3 class=\"panel-title\">Source Code Example</h3>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"panel-body\">\n                        <p>For the above Log Injection vulnerability, example and fix can be found at\n                        <code>routes/session.js</code></p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <!-- /Log Injection -->\n\n</div>\n<!-- end accordions -->\n\n        </div>\n        <!-- /#page-wrapper -->\n\n    </div>\n    <!-- /#wrapper -->\n\n    <script src=\"../vendor/jquery.min.js\"></script>",

Vulnerabilities may vary depending on the logging facility:</p>\n                        <h5>1. Log Forging (CRLF) </h5>\n                        <p>Lets consider an example where an application logs a failed attempt to login to the system. A very common example for this is as follows:\n                        </p>\n                        <pre>\nvar userName = req.body.userName;\nconsole.log('Error: attempt to login with invalid user: ', userName);\n                        </pre>\n                        <p>When user input is unsanitized and the output mechanism is an ordinary terminal stdout facility then the application will be vulnerable to CRLF injection, where an attacker can create a malicious payload as follows:\n                        <pre>\ncurl http://localhost:4000/login -X POST --data 'userName=vyva%0aError: alex moldovan failed $1,000,000 transaction&password=Admin_123&_csrf='\n                        </pre>\n                        Where the <code>userName</code> parameter is encoding in the request the LF symbol which will result in a new line to begin. Resulting log output will look as follows:\n                        <pre>\nError: attempt to login with invalid user:  vyva\nError: alex moldovan failed $1,000,000 transaction\n                        </pre>\n                        <br/>\n                        <h5>2. Log Injection Escalation </h5>\n                        <p>\n                            An attacker may craft malicious input in hope of an escalated attack where the target isn't the logs themselves, but rather the actual logging system. For example, if an application has a back-office web app that manages viewing and tracking the logs, then an attacker may send an XSS payload into the log, which may not result in log forging on the log itself, but when viewed by a system administrator on the log viewing web app then it may compromise it and result in XSS injection that if the logs app is vulnerable.\n                        </p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n                    <div class=\"panel-heading\">\n                        <h3 class=\"panel-title\">How Do I Prevent It?</h3>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"panel-body\">\n\n                        As always when dealing with user input:\n                        <ul>\n                            <li>\n                                Do not allow user input into logs\n                            </li>\n                            <li>\n                                Encode to proper context, or sanitize user input\n                            </li>\n                        </ul>\n\n                        Encoding example:\n                        <pre>\n// Step 1: Require a module that supports encoding\nvar ESAPI = require('node-esapi');\n// - Step 2: Encode the user input that will be logged in the correct context\n// following are a few examples:\nconsole.log('Error: attempt to login with invalid user: %s', ESAPI.encoder().encodeForHTML(userName));\nconsole.log('Error: attempt to login with invalid user: %s', ESAPI.encoder().encodeForJavaScript(userName));\nconsole.log('Error: attempt to login with invalid user: %s', ESAPI.encoder().encodeForURL(userName));\n                        </pre>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n                    <div class=\"panel-heading\">\n                        <h3 class=\"panel-title\">Source Code Example</h3>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"panel-body\">\n                        <p>For the above Log Injection vulnerability, example and fix can be found at\n                        <code>routes/session.js</code></p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <!-- /Log Injection -->\n\n</div>\n<!-- end accordions -->\n\n        </div>\n        <!-- /#page-wrapper -->\n\n    </div>\n    <!-- /#wrapper -->\n\n    <script src=\"../vendor/jquery.min.js\"></script>",

Here is related code in\n                            <code>data/user-dao.js</code>\n                            <code>addUser()</code>method:\n                            <pre>\n// Create user document\nvar user = {\n    userName: userName,\n    firstName: firstName,\n    lastName: lastName,\n    password: password //received from request param\n};\n                        </pre> To secure it, handle password storage in a safer way by using one way encryption using salt hashing as below:</p>\n                        <pre>\n// Generate password hash\nvar salt = bcrypt.genSaltSync();\nvar passwordHash = bcrypt.hashSync(password, salt);\n\n// Create user document\nvar user = {\n    userName: userName,\n    firstName: firstName,\n    lastName: lastName,\n    password: passwordHash\n};\n                        </pre> This hash password can not be decrypted, hence more secure. To compare the password when user logs in, the user entered password gets converted to hash and compared with the hash in storage.\n\n                        <pre>\nif (bcrypt.compareSync(password, user.password)) {\n    callback(null, user);\n} else {\n    callback(invalidPasswordError, null);\n}\n                        </pre> Note: The bcrypt module also provides asynchronous methods for creating and comparing hash.\n                        <br/>\n                        <br/>\n                        <h3>2. Session timeout and protecting cookies in transit</h3>\n\n                        <p>The insecure demo application does not contain any provision to timeout user session. The session stays active until user explicitly logs out.</p>\n\n                        <p>In addition to that, the app does not prevent cookies being accessed in script, making application vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Also cookies are not prevented to get sent on insecure HTTP connection.</p>\n\n                        <p>To secure the application:</p>\n                        <p>1. Use session based timeouts, terminate session when browser closes.</p>\n                        <pre>\n// Enable session management using express middleware\napp.use(express.cookieParser());\n </pre>\n                        <p>2. In addition, sets\n                            <code>HTTPOnly</code>HTTP header preventing cookies being accessed by scripts. The application used HTTPS secure connections, and cookies are configured to be sent only on Secure HTTPS connections by setting\n                            <code>Secure</code>flag.\n                            <pre>\napp.use(express.session({\n    secret: \"s3Cur3\",\n    cookie: {\n        httpOnly: true,\n        secure: true\n    }\n}));\n                        </pre>\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                            3. When user clicks logout, destroy the session and session cookie\n                            <pre>\nreq.session.destroy(function() {\n    res.redirect(\"/\");\n});\n                        </pre> Note: The example code uses\n                            <code>MemoryStore</code>to manage session data, which is not designed for production environment, as it will leak memory, and will not scale past a single process. Use database based storage MongoStore or RedisStore for production. Alternatively, sessions can be managed using popular passport module.\n                        <br/>\n                        <br/>\n                        <h3>3. Session hijacking</h3>\n\n                        <p>The insecure demo application does not regenerate a new session id upon user's login, therefore rendering a vulnerability of session hijacking if an attacker is able to somehow steal the cookie with the session id and use it.\n\n                        <p>Upon login, a security best practice with regards to cookies session management would be to regenerate the session id so that if an id was already created for a user on an insecure medium (i.e: non-HTTPS website or otherwise), or if an attacker was able to get their hands on the cookie id before the user logged-in, then the old session id will render useless as the logged-in user with new privileges holds a new session id now.\n                    </p>\n\n                        <p>To secure the application:</p>\n                        <p>1.

sensitive information retained by the browser, or redirect user to malicious sites.\n            </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"panel panel-info\">\n            <div

Otherwise an attacker can use non-state mutating methods (such as GET) to bypass the CSRF middleware checks, and use method override header to convert request to desired method.</p>\n                <p>When form is submitted, the middleware checks for existence of token and validates it by matching to the generated token for the response-request pair. If tokens do not match, it rejects the request. Thus making it really hard for an attacker to exploit CSRF.\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"panel panel-info\">\n            <div class=\"panel-heading\">\n                <h3 class=\"panel-title\">Source Code Example</h3>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"panel-body\">\n                The\n                <code>server.js</code>includes the express CSRF middleware after session is initialized. Then creates a custom middleware to generate new token using\n                <code>req.csrfToken();</code>and exposes it to view by setting it in\n                <code>res.locals</code>\n                <pre>\n        //Enable Express csrf protection\n        app.use(express.csrf());\n\n        app.use(function(req, res, next) { \n            res.locals.csrftoken = req.csrfToken(); \n            next(); \n        }); </pre> Next, this token can be included in a hidden form field in\n                <code>views/profile.html</code>as below.\n                <pre>\n    &lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_csrf\" value=\"{{ csrftoken } }\"&gt;</pre>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n        </div>\n        <!-- /#page-wrapper -->\n\n    </div>\n    <!-- /#wrapper -->\n\n    <script src=\"../vendor/jquery.min.js\"></script>",
