In this case, it is much harder to predict the generated integers.\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction securePassword() {\n    // GOOD: the random suffix is cryptographically secure\n    var suffix = window.crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint32Array(1))[0];\n    var password = \"myPassword\" + suffix;\n    \n    // GOOD: if a random value between 0 and 1 is desired\n    var secret = window.crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint32Array(1))[0] * Math.pow(2,-32);\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Wikipedia: [Pseudo-random number generator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator).\n* Mozilla Developer Network: [Crypto: getRandomValues()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Crypto/getRandomValues).\n* NodeJS: [crypto.randomBytes](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#crypto_crypto_randombytes_size_callback)\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-338](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/338.html).\n"},"properties":{"tags":["security","external/cwe/cwe-338"],"description":"Using a cryptographically weak pseudo-random number generator to generate a\n              security-sensitive value may allow an attacker to predict what value will\n              be generated.","id":"js/insecure-randomness","kind":"path-problem","name":"Insecure randomness","precision":"high","problem.severity":"warning","security-severity":"7.8"}},{"id":"js/server-side-unvalidated-url-redirection","name":"js/server-side-unvalidated-url-redirection","shortDescription":{"text":"Server-side URL redirect"},"fullDescription":{"text":"Server-side URL redirection based on unvalidated user input may cause redirection to malicious web sites."},"defaultConfiguration":{"enabled":true,"level":"warning"},"help":{"text":"# Server-side URL redirect\nDirectly incorporating user input into a URL redirect request without validating the input can facilitate phishing attacks.

For example, by providing a filename like `foo.txt; rm -rf .`, the user can first count the lines in `foo.txt` and subsequently delete all files in the current directory.\n\nTo avoid this catastrophic behavior, use an API such as `child_process.execFileSync` that does not spawn a shell by default:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar cp = require(\"child_process\"),\n    http = require('http'),\n    url = require('url');\n\nvar server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {\n    let file = url.parse(req.url, true).query.path;\n\n    cp.execFileSync('wc', ['-l', file]); // GOOD\n});\n\n```\nIf you want to allow the user to specify other options to `wc`, you can use a library like `shell-quote` to parse the user input into an array of arguments without risking command injection:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar cp = require(\"child_process\"),\n    http = require('http'),\n    url = require('url'),\n    shellQuote = require('shell-quote');\n\nvar server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {\n    let options = url.parse(req.url, true).query.options;\n\n    cp.execFileSync('wc', shellQuote.parse(options)); // GOOD\n});\n\n```\nAlternatively, the original example can be made safe by checking the filename against an allowlist of safe characters before using it:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar cp = require(\"child_process\"),\n    http = require('http'),\n    url = require('url');\n\nvar server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {\n    let file = url.parse(req.url, true).query.path;\n\n    // only allow safe characters in file name\n    if (file.match(/^[\\w\\.\\-\\/]+$/)) {\n        cp.execSync(`wc -l ${file}`); // GOOD\n    }\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Command Injection](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Command_Injection).\n* npm: [shell-quote](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shell-quote).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-78](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-88](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/88.html).\n"},"properties":{"tags":["correctness","security","external/cwe/cwe-078","external/cwe/cwe-088"],"description":"Using externally controlled strings in a command line may allow a malicious\n              user to change the meaning of the command.","id":"js/command-line-injection","kind":"path-problem","name":"Uncontrolled command line","precision":"high","problem.severity":"error","security-severity":"9.8"}},{"id":"js/shell-command-constructed-from-input","name":"js/shell-command-constructed-from-input","shortDescription":{"text":"Unsafe shell command constructed from library input"},"fullDescription":{"text":"Using externally controlled strings in a command line may allow a malicious user to change the meaning of the command."},"defaultConfiguration":{"enabled":true,"level":"error"},"help":{"text":"# Unsafe shell command constructed from library input\nDynamically constructing a shell command with inputs from exported functions may inadvertently change the meaning of the shell command.

As a consequence, anyone can impersonate the remote server, and receive the confidential information.\n\n\n```javascript\nlet https = require(\"https\");\n\nhttps.request(\n  {\n    hostname: \"secure.my-online-bank.com\",\n    port: 443,\n    method: \"POST\",\n    path: \"send-confidential-information\",\n    rejectUnauthorized: false // BAD\n  },\n  response => {\n    // ... communicate with secure.my-online-bank.com\n  }\n);\n\n```\nTo make the connection secure, the `rejectUnauthorized` option should have its default value, or be explicitly set to `true`.\n\n\n## References\n* Wikipedia: [Transport Layer Security (TLS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security)\n* Wikipedia: [Man-in-the-middle attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack)\n* Node.js: [TLS (SSL)](https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html)\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-295](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/295.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-297](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/297.html).\n"},"properties":{"tags":["security","external/cwe/cwe-295","external/cwe/cwe-297"],"description":"Disabling cryptographic certificate validation can cause security vulnerabilities.","id":"js/disabling-certificate-validation","kind":"problem","name":"Disabling certificate validation","precision":"very-high","problem.severity":"error","security-severity":"7.5"}},{"id":"js/xpath-injection","name":"js/xpath-injection","shortDescription":{"text":"XPath injection"},"fullDescription":{"text":"Building an XPath expression from user-controlled sources is vulnerable to insertion of malicious code by the user."},"defaultConfiguration":{"enabled":true,"level":"error"},"help":{"text":"# XPath injection\nIf an XPath expression is built using string concatenation, and the components of the concatenation include user input, it makes it very easy for a user to create a malicious XPath expression.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nIf user input must be included in an XPath expression, either sanitize the data or use variable references to safely embed it without altering the structure of the expression.\n\n\n## Example\nIn this example, the code accepts a user name specified by the user, and uses this unvalidated and unsanitized value in an XPath expression constructed using the `xpath` package.

The `$.find` function will only interpret `target` as a CSS selector and never as HTML, thereby preventing an XSS attack.\n\n\n```javascript\n$(\"button\").click(function () {\n    var target = $(this).attr(\"data-target\");\n\t$.find(target).hide();\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [DOM based XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/DOM_based_XSS_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* OWASP: [XSS (Cross Site Scripting) Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* OWASP [DOM Based XSS](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/DOM_Based_XSS).\n* OWASP [Types of Cross-Site Scripting](https://owasp.org/www-community/Types_of_Cross-Site_Scripting).\n* Wikipedia: [Cross-site scripting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html).\n"},"properties":{"tags":["security","external/cwe/cwe-079","external/cwe/cwe-116"],"description":"Reinterpreting text from the DOM as HTML\n              can lead to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.","id":"js/xss-through-dom","kind":"path-problem","name":"DOM text reinterpreted as HTML","precision":"high","problem.severity":"warning","security-severity":"6.1"}},{"id":"js/xss-through-exception","name":"js/xss-through-exception","shortDescription":{"text":"Exception text reinterpreted as HTML"},"fullDescription":{"text":"Reinterpreting text from an exception as HTML can lead to a cross-site scripting vulnerability."},"defaultConfiguration":{"enabled":true,"level":"warning"},"help":{"text":"# Exception text reinterpreted as HTML\nDirectly writing error messages to a webpage without sanitization allows for a cross-site scripting vulnerability if parts of the error message can be influenced by a user.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nTo guard against cross-site scripting, consider using contextual output encoding/escaping before writing user input to the page, or one of the other solutions that are mentioned in the references.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows an exception being written directly to the document, and this exception can potentially be influenced by the page URL, leaving the website vulnerable to cross-site scripting.\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction setLanguageOptions() {\n    var href = document.location.href,\n        deflt = href.substring(href.indexOf(\"default=\")+8);\n    \n    try {\n        var parsed = unknownParseFunction(deflt); \n    } catch(e) {\n        document.write(\"Had an error: \" + e + \".\");\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n## Example\nThis second example shows an input being validated using the JSON schema validator `ajv`, and in case of an error, the error message is sent directly back in the response.\n\n\n```javascript\nimport express from 'express';\nimport Ajv from 'ajv';\n\nlet app = express();\nlet ajv = new Ajv();\n\najv.addSchema({type: 'object', additionalProperties: {type: 'number'}}, 'pollData');\n\napp.post('/polldata', (req, res) => {\n    if (!ajv.validate('pollData', req.body)) {\n        res.send(ajv.errorsText());\n    }\n});\n\n```\nThis is unsafe, because the error message can contain parts of the input.

The user input may contain a query object, so this code is vulnerable to a NoSQL injection attack.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst mongoose = require(\"mongoose\");\nconst Todo = mongoose.model(\n  \"Todo\",\n  new mongoose.Schema({ text: { type: String } }, { timestamps: true })\n);\n\nconst app = express();\napp.use(express.json());\napp.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));\n\napp.delete(\"/api/delete\", async (req, res) => {\n  let id = req.body.id;\n\n  await Todo.deleteOne({ _id: id }); // BAD: id might be an object with special properties\n\n  res.json({ status: \"ok\" });\n});\n\n```\nTo fix this vulnerability, we can use the `$eq` operator to ensure that the user input is interpreted as a literal value and not as a query object:\n\n\n```javascript\napp.delete(\"/api/delete\", async (req, res) => {\n  let id = req.body.id;\n  await Todo.deleteOne({ _id: { $eq: id } }); // GOOD: using $eq operator for the comparison\n\n  res.json({ status: \"ok\" });\n});\n```\nAlternatively check that the user input is a literal value and not a query object before using it:\n\n\n```javascript\napp.delete(\"/api/delete\", async (req, res) => {\n  let id = req.body.id;\n  if (typeof id !== \"string\") {\n    res.status(400).json({ status: \"error\" });\n    return;\n  }\n  await Todo.deleteOne({ _id: id }); // GOOD: id is guaranteed to be a string\n\n  res.json({ status: \"ok\" });\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Wikipedia: [SQL injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection).\n* MongoDB: [$eq operator](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/eq).\n* OWASP: [NoSQL injection](https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/GOD16-NOSQL.pdf).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-90](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/90.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-943](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/943.html).\n"},"properties":{"tags":["security","external/cwe/cwe-089","external/cwe/cwe-090","external/cwe/cwe-943"],"description":"Building a database query from user-controlled sources is vulnerable to insertion of\n              malicious code by the user.","id":"js/sql-injection","kind":"path-problem","name":"Database query built from user-controlled sources","precision":"high","problem.severity":"error","security-severity":"8.8"}},{"id":"js/host-header-forgery-in-email-generation","name":"js/host-header-forgery-in-email-generation","shortDescription":{"text":"Host header poisoning in email generation"},"fullDescription":{"text":"Using the HTTP Host header to construct a link in an email can facilitate phishing attacks and leak password reset tokens."},"defaultConfiguration":{"enabled":true,"level":"error"},"help":{"text":"# Host header poisoning in email generation\nUsing the HTTP Host header to construct a link in an email can facilitate phishing attacks and leak password reset tokens.

It does so for all non-`img` and non-`area` tags, by using a regular expression with two capture groups.

But even a sanitized input can be dangerous to use if it is modified further before a browser treats it as HTML. A seemingly innocent transformation that expands a self-closing HTML tag from `<div attr=\"{sanitized}\"/>` to `<div attr=\"{sanitized}\"></div>` may in fact cause cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nUse a well-tested sanitization library if at all possible, and avoid modifying sanitized values further before treating them as HTML.\n\nAn even safer alternative is to design the application so that sanitization is not needed, for instance by using HTML templates that are explicit about the values they treat as HTML.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following function transforms a self-closing HTML tag to a pair of open/close tags. It does so for all non-`img` and non-`area` tags, by using a regular expression with two capture groups. The first capture group corresponds to the name of the tag, and the second capture group to the content of the tag.\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction expandSelfClosingTags(html) {\n\tvar rxhtmlTag = /<(?!img|area)(([a-z][^\\w\\/>]*)[^>]*)\\/>/gi;\n\treturn html.replace(rxhtmlTag, \"<$1></$2>\"); // BAD\n}\n\n```\nWhile it is generally known regular expressions are ill-suited for parsing HTML, variants of this particular transformation pattern have long been considered safe.\n\nHowever, the function is not safe.

Alternatively, block the property names `__proto__` and `constructor` from being merged or assigned to.\n\n\n## Example\nThis function recursively copies properties from `src` to `dst`:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction merge(dst, src) {\n    for (let key in src) {\n        if (!src.hasOwnProperty(key)) continue;\n        if (isObject(dst[key])) {\n            merge(dst[key], src[key]);\n        } else {\n            dst[key] = src[key];\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n```\nHowever, if `src` is the object `{\"__proto__\": {\"isAdmin\": true}}`, it will inject the property `isAdmin: true` in `Object.prototype`.\n\nThe issue can be fixed by ensuring that only own properties of the destination object are merged recursively:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction merge(dst, src) {\n    for (let key in src) {\n        if (!src.hasOwnProperty(key)) continue;\n        if (dst.hasOwnProperty(key) && isObject(dst[key])) {\n            merge(dst[key], src[key]);\n        } else {\n            dst[key] = src[key];\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n```\nAlternatively, block the `__proto__` and `constructor` properties:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction merge(dst, src) {\n    for (let key in src) {\n        if (!src.hasOwnProperty(key)) continue;\n        if (key === \"__proto__\" || key === \"constructor\") continue;\n        if (isObject(dst[key])) {\n            merge(dst[key], src[key]);\n        } else {\n            dst[key] = src[key];\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Prototype pollution attacks: [lodash](https://hackerone.com/reports/380873), [jQuery](https://hackerone.com/reports/454365), [extend](https://hackerone.com/reports/381185), [just-extend](https://hackerone.com/reports/430291), [merge.recursive](https://hackerone.com/reports/381194).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-78](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-94](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-471](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/471.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-915](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/915.html).\n"},"properties":{"tags":["security","external/cwe/cwe-078","external/cwe/cwe-079","external/cwe/cwe-094","external/cwe/cwe-400","external/cwe/cwe-471","external/cwe/cwe-915"],"description":"Functions recursively assigning properties on objects may be\n              the cause of accidental modification of a built-in prototype object.","id":"js/prototype-pollution-utility","kind":"path-problem","name":"Prototype-polluting function","precision":"high","problem.severity":"warning","security-severity":"6.1"}},{"id":"js/prototype-polluting-assignment","name":"js/prototype-polluting-assignment","shortDescription":{"text":"Prototype-polluting assignment"},"fullDescription":{"text":"Modifying an object obtained via a user-controlled property name may lead to accidental mutation of the built-in Object prototype, and possibly escalate to remote code execution or cross-site scripting."},"defaultConfiguration":{"enabled":true,"level":"warning"},"help":{"text":"# Prototype-polluting assignment\nMost JavaScript objects inherit the properties of the built-in `Object.prototype` object.

If, for example, `action` is `rewind`, `action` will be `undefined` and the call will result in a runtime error.\n\nThe easiest way to prevent this is to turn `actions` into a `Map` and using `Map.prototype.has` to check whether the method name is valid before looking it up.\n\n\n```javascript\nvar express = require('express');\nvar app = express();\n\nvar actions = new Map();\nactions.set(\"play\", function play(data) {\n  // ...\n});\nactions.set(\"pause\", function pause(data) {\n  // ...\n});\n\napp.get('/perform/:action/:payload', function(req, res) {\n  if (actions.has(req.params.action)) {\n    if (typeof actions.get(req.params.action) === 'function'){\n      let action = actions.get(req.params.action);\n    }\n    // GOOD: `action` is either the `play` or the `pause` function from above\n    res.end(action(req.params.payload));\n  } else {\n    res.end(\"Unsupported action.\");\n  }\n});\n\n```\nIf `actions` cannot be turned into a `Map`, a `hasOwnProperty` check should be added to validate the method name:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar express = require('express');\nvar app = express();\n\nvar actions = {\n  play(data) {\n    // ...\n  },\n  pause(data) {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\napp.get('/perform/:action/:payload', function(req, res) {\n  if (actions.hasOwnProperty(req.params.action)) {\n    let action = actions[req.params.action];\n    if (typeof action === 'function') {\n      // GOOD: `action` is an own method of `actions`\n      res.end(action(req.params.payload));\n      return;\n    }\n  }\n  res.end(\"Unsupported action.\");\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Denial of Service](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Denial_of_Service).\n* MDN: [Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map).\n* MDN: [Object.prototype](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/prototype).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-754](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/754.html).\n","markdown":"# Unvalidated dynamic method call\nJavaScript makes it easy to look up object properties dynamically at runtime. In particular, methods can be looked up by name and then called. However, if the method name is user-controlled, an attacker could choose a name that makes the application invoke an unexpected method, which may cause a runtime exception. If this exception is not handled, it could be used to mount a denial-of-service attack.\n\nFor example, there might not be a method of the given name, or the result of the lookup might not be a function. In either case the method call will throw a `TypeError` at runtime.\n\nAnother, more subtle example is where the result of the lookup is a standard library method from `Object.prototype`, which most objects have on their prototype chain. Examples of such methods include `valueOf`, `hasOwnProperty` and `__defineSetter__`. If the method call passes the wrong number or kind of arguments to these methods, they will throw an exception.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nIt is best to avoid dynamic method lookup involving user-controlled names altogether, for instance by using a `Map` instead of a plain object.\n\nIf the dynamic method lookup cannot be avoided, consider whitelisting permitted method names.

If an attacker can persuade a user to click on a link to such a URL, the attacker can evaluate arbitrary JavaScript in the browser of the user to, for example, steal cookies containing session information.\n\n\n```javascript\neval(document.location.href.substring(document.location.href.indexOf(\"default=\")+8))\n\n```\nThe following example shows a Pug template being constructed from user input, allowing attackers to run arbitrary code via a payload such as `#{global.process.exit(1)}`.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express')\nvar pug = require('pug');\nconst app = express()\n\napp.post('/', (req, res) => {\n    var input = req.query.username;\n    var template = `\ndoctype\nhtml\nhead\n    title= 'Hello world'\nbody\n    form(action='/' method='post')\n        input#name.form-control(type='text)\n        button.btn.btn-primary(type='submit') Submit\n    p Hello `+ input\n    var fn = pug.compile(template);\n    var html = fn();\n    res.send(html);\n})\n\n```\nBelow is an example of how to use a template engine without any risk of template injection.

Examples include AngularJS expressions or JQuery selectors.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nAvoid including user input in any expression which may be dynamically evaluated.

The second receives this sensitive information from the request body of a POST request.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\napp.use(require('body-parser').urlencoded({ extended: false }))\n\n// bad: sensitive information is read from query parameters\napp.get('/login1', (req, res) => {\n    const user = req.query.user;\n    const password = req.query.password;\n    if (checkUser(user, password)) {\n        res.send('Welcome');\n    } else {\n        res.send('Access denied');\n    }\n});\n\n// good: sensitive information is read from post body\napp.post('/login2', (req, res) => {\n    const user = req.body.user;\n    const password = req.body.password;\n    if (checkUser(user, password)) {\n        res.send('Welcome');\n    } else {\n        res.send('Access denied');\n    }\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* CWE: [CWE-598: Use of GET Request Method with Sensitive Query Strings](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/598.html)\n* PortSwigger (Burp): [Password Submitted using GET Method](https://portswigger.net/kb/issues/00400300_password-submitted-using-get-method)\n* OWASP: [Information Exposure through Query Strings in URL](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Information_exposure_through_query_strings_in_url)\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-598](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/598.html).\n"},"properties":{"tags":["security","external/cwe/cwe-598"],"description":"Placing sensitive data in a GET request increases the risk of\n              the data being exposed to an attacker.","id":"js/sensitive-get-query","kind":"problem","name":"Sensitive data read from GET request","precision":"high","problem.severity":"warning","security-severity":"6.5"}},{"id":"js/tainted-format-string","name":"js/tainted-format-string","shortDescription":{"text":"Use of externally-controlled format string"},"fullDescription":{"text":"Using external input in format strings can lead to garbled output."},"defaultConfiguration":{"enabled":true,"level":"warning"},"help":{"text":"# Use of externally-controlled format string\nFunctions like the Node.js standard library function `util.format` accept a format string that is used to format the remaining arguments by providing inline format specifiers.

Whenever that error message occurs for an end user, the developer can use the stack trace to help identify how to fix the problem. In particular, stack traces can tell the developer more about the sequence of events that led to a failure, as opposed to merely the final state of the software when the error occurred.\n\nUnfortunately, the same information can be useful to an attacker. The sequence of function names in a stack trace can reveal the structure of the application as well as any internal components it relies on.

This is both safer and more portable.\n\nIf given arguments as a single string, avoid simply splitting the string on whitespace. Arguments may contain quoted whitespace, causing them to split into multiple arguments. Use a library like `shell-quote` to parse the string into an array of arguments instead.\n\nIf this approach is not viable, then add code to verify that each forwarded command-line argument is properly escaped before using it.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following wrapper script example executes another JavaScript file in a child process and forwards some command-line arguments. This is problematic because the special characters in the command-line arguments may change the meaning of the child process invocation unexpectedly.

This is both safer and more portable.\n\nIf given arguments as a single string, avoid simply splitting the string on whitespace. Arguments may contain quoted whitespace, causing them to split into multiple arguments. Use a library like `shell-quote` to parse the string into an array of arguments instead.\n\nIf this approach is not viable, then add code to verify that each forwarded command-line argument is properly escaped before using it.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following wrapper script example executes another JavaScript file in a child process and forwards some command-line arguments. This is problematic because the special characters in the command-line arguments may change the meaning of the child process invocation unexpectedly.

If a malicious user provides \\`username=Guest%0a\\[INFO\\]+User:+Admin%0a\\` as a username parameter, the log entry will be splitted in two different lines, where the second line will be \\`\\[INFO\\]+User:+Admin\\`.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst http = require('http');\nconst url = require('url');\n\nconst server = http.createServer((req, res) => {\n    let q = url.parse(req.url, true);\n\n    console.info(`[INFO] User: ${q.query.username}`); // BAD: User input logged as-is\n})\n\nserver.listen(3000, '127.0.0.1', () => {});\n\n```\nIn the second example, `String.prototype.replace` is used to ensure no line endings are present in the user input.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst http = require('http');\nconst url = require('url');\n\nconst server = http.createServer((req, res) => {\n    let q = url.parse(req.url, true);\n\n    // GOOD: remove newlines from user controlled input before logging\n    let username = q.query.username.replace(/\\n|\\r/g, \"\");\n\n    console.info(`[INFO] User: ${username}`);\n});\n\nserver.listen(3000, '127.0.0.1', () => {});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Log Injection](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Log_Injection).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-117](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/117.html).\n"},"properties":{"tags":["security","external/cwe/cwe-117"],"description":"Building log entries from user-controlled sources is vulnerable to\n              insertion of forged log entries by a malicious user.","id":"js/log-injection","kind":"path-problem","name":"Log injection","precision":"medium","problem.severity":"error","security-severity":"6.1"}},{"id":"js/summary/lines-of-user-code","name":"js/summary/lines-of-user-code","shortDescription":{"text":"Total lines of user written JavaScript and TypeScript code in the database"},"fullDescription":{"text":"The total number of lines of JavaScript and TypeScript code from the source code directory, excluding auto-generated files and files in `node_modules`.

Hence the example can be rewritten as follows, eliminating the useless variable:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar f = function () {\n  return \"Hi!\";\n};\nf();\n```\nA similar situation can occur with ECMAScript 2015 module exports, as shown in the following example:\n\n\n```javascript\nexport default function f() {\n  return \"Hi!\";\n};\n```\nAgain, the named function expression implicitly declares a variable `f`, but because the export statement is a default export, this variable is unused and can be eliminated:\n\n\n```javascript\nexport default function () {\n  return \"Hi!\";\n};\n```\n\n## References\n* Coding Horror: [Code Smells](http://blog.codinghorror.com/code-smells/).\n* Mozilla Developer Network: [Named function expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/function#Named_function_expression).\n* Mozilla Developer Network: [Using the default export](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export#Using_the_default_export).\n"},"properties":{"tags":["quality","maintainability","useless-code"],"description":"Unused variables, imports, functions or classes may be a symptom of a bug\n              and should be examined carefully.","id":"js/unused-local-variable","kind":"problem","name":"Unused variable, import, function or class","precision":"very-high","problem.severity":"recommendation"}},{"id":"js/suspicious-method-name-declaration","name":"js/suspicious-method-name-declaration","shortDescription":{"text":"Suspicious method name declaration"},"fullDescription":{"text":"A method declaration with a name that is a special keyword in another context is suspicious."},"defaultConfiguration":{"enabled":true,"level":"warning"},"help":{"text":"# Suspicious method name declaration\nIn TypeScript, certain keywords have special meanings for member declarations, and misusing them can create confusion:\n\n* In classes, use `constructor` rather than `new` to declare constructors.

(Note that this may not be true on older browsers.)\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction getConverter(dir) {\n\tif (dir === 'c2f') {\n\t\tfunction converter(c) {\n\t\t\treturn c * 9/5 + 32;\n\t\t}\n\t} else {\n\t\tfunction converter(f) {\n\t\t\treturn (f - 32) * 5/9;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\treturn converter;\n}\n```\nTo address this problem, introduce a local variable `converter` and convert the function declarations into assignments of function expressions to this variable:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction getConverter(dir) {\n\tvar converter;\n\tif (dir === 'c2f') {\n\t\tconverter = function (c) {\n\t\t\treturn c * 9/5 + 32;\n\t\t};\n\t} else {\n\t\tconverter = function (f) {\n\t\t\treturn (f - 32) * 5/9;\n\t\t};\n\t}\n\treturn converter;\n}\n```\n\n## References\n* Ecma International, *ECMAScript Language Definition*, 5.1 Edition, Section 10.5.

Conversely, if it should happen to have a property `addRecord`, the function call will attempt to invoke the value of this property as a method.\n\nTo clarify the intended meaning of the code, the `with` statement should be removed and property accesses should be introduced to make it explicit which names are intended to be read from `record`, and which ones are intended to be looked up in enclosing scopes:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction process(record) {\n\taddRecord(record.firstName + \" \" + record.lastName, record.email);\n}\n```\nNote that `with` statements are not allowed in strict mode code.\n\n\n## References\n* D.

If it is not actually meant to be invoked as a constructor, turn all constructor calls to it into normal function calls. If it *is* meant to be invoked as a constructor, either turn all normal function calls to it into constructor calls, or introduce a guard for intercepting calls without `new` as described below.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the following example, `Point` is clearly meant to be a constructor function, but on line 7 it is invoked without `new`. This means that `this` in the function body will refer to the global object, so the assignments to `x` and `y` will create global variables.\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction Point(x, y) {\n  this.x = x;\n  this.y = y;\n}\n\nvar p = new Point(23, 42),\n    q = Point(56, 72);\n\n```\nThe easiest way to fix this is to rewrite the call on line 7 to use `new`:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction Point(x, y) {\n  this.x = x;\n  this.y = y;\n}\n\nvar p = new Point(23, 42),\n    q = new Point(56, 72);\n\n```\nAlternatively, if you absolutely have to make it possible to call `Point` both with and without `new`, you could insert a guard that intercepts calls without `new` as follows:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction Point(x, y) {\n  if (!(this instanceof Point))\n    return new Point(x, y);\n  this.x = x;\n  this.y = y;\n}\n\nvar p = new Point(23, 42),\n    q = Point(56, 72);\n\n```\nNow, if `Point` is invoked without `new`, its `this` object (which is the global object) is not an instance of `Point`, so the \"then\" branch of the `if` statement is executed, which re-invokes `Point` on the same arguments, but this time with `new`.\n\n\n## References\n* D.

ECMAScript 5-compatible platforms provide a library function `Array.isArray` that can be used instead:\n\n\n```javascript\nif (Array.isArray(a))\n\tconsole.log(\"It's an array!\");\n```\nOn older platforms, you can use the technique explained on the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/isArray#Compatibility).\n\n\n## References\n* Mozilla Developer Network: [typeof](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof).\n* Mozilla Developer Network: [Array.isArray()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/isArray).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-570](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/570.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-571](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/571.html).\n"},"properties":{"tags":["quality","reliability","correctness","language-features","external/cwe/cwe-570","external/cwe/cwe-571"],"description":"Comparing the result of a typeof test against a string other than 'undefined',\n              'boolean', 'number', 'string', 'object', 'function' or 'symbol' is useless, since\n              this comparison can never succeed.","id":"js/useless-type-test","kind":"problem","name":"Useless type test","precision":"very-high","problem.severity":"error"}},{"id":"js/illegal-invocation","name":"js/illegal-invocation","shortDescription":{"text":"Illegal invocation"},"fullDescription":{"text":"Attempting to invoke a method or an arrow function using 'new', or invoking a constructor as a function, will cause a runtime error."},"defaultConfiguration":{"enabled":true,"level":"error"},"help":{"text":"# Illegal invocation\nClass methods and arrow functions must not be invoked using `new`, and attempting to do so will result in a runtime error.\n\nConversely, constructors can only be invoked using `new` or `super(...)`, and attempting to invoke them as a normal function will result in a runtime error.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nCorrect the invocation in question by adding or removing `new` as appropriate.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the following example, `Point` is a class, but on line 8 it is invoked without `new`.

After removing the element at index 0, the loop counter is incremented to 1, but the second \"`..`\" string has now been shifted down to index 0 and will therefore be skipped.\n\nOne way to avoid this is to decrement the loop counter after removing an element from the array:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction removePathTraversal(path) {\n  let parts = path.split('/');\n  for (let i = 0; i < parts.length; ++i) {\n    if (parts[i] === '..') {\n      parts.splice(i, 1);\n      --i; // adjust for array shift\n    }\n  }\n  return path.join('/');\n}\n\n```\nAlternatively, use the `filter` method:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction removePathTraversal(path) {\n  return path.split('/').filter(part => part !== '..').join('/');\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* MDN: [Array.prototype.splice()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice).\n* MDN: [Array.prototype.filter()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter).\n"},"properties":{"tags":["quality","reliability","correctness"],"description":"Removing elements from an array while iterating over it can cause the loop to skip over some elements,\n              unless the loop index is decremented accordingly.","id":"js/loop-iteration-skipped-due-to-shifting","kind":"problem","name":"Loop iteration skipped due to shifting","precision":"high","problem.severity":"warning"}},{"id":"js/misleading-indentation-after-control-statement","name":"js/misleading-indentation-after-control-statement","shortDescription":{"text":"Misleading indentation after control statement"},"fullDescription":{"text":"The body of a control statement should have appropriate indentation to clarify which statements it controls and which ones it does not control."},"defaultConfiguration":{"enabled":true,"level":"warning"},"help":{"text":"# Misleading indentation after control statement\nLoop bodies and the 'then' and 'else' branches of `if` statements can either be block statements delimited by curly braces, or simple statements.
